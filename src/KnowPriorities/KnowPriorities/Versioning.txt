Versioning is done both on the NuGet/Assembly level, but also as folder namespacing.

This is done so versions can be replaced in their entirety without preventing the ability for bug fixes on prior versions.

It is intended to only support 1 prior version, mainly or only as bug fixes.

This is to allow a gradual progression from major version to version, at least as best as possible.
